This repo is a fork of [Avzag](https://github.com/alkaitagi/Avzag) project for _IU-S21-MAP_ course. During the course the **team** of [@qazybi](https://github.com/QazyBi), [@alkaitagi](https://github.com/alkaitagi/), [@annwhoorma](https://github.com/annwhoorma) will develop the new Dictionary module for the application. The web site is written using VueJS framework in TypeScript language.

The goal of the project is to develop a cross-lingual dictionary with efficient search and rich data representation. The system should provide capability for searching offline, and in various grammatical forms and usage samples for the dictionary entries.
